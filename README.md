# Dynamic Table Creator Plugin
 Dynamic Table Creator - WordPress Plugin

## Overview

Dynamic Table Creator is a WordPress plugin that allows users to create dynamic HTML tables. Users can easily add rows and columns, select and delete rows and columns, and import and export tables in CSV format. The table data is saved to the database, and each generated table comes with a shortcode that can be embedded on any page.

## Features

- **Add Rows and Columns**: Easily add new rows and columns to your tables.
- **Select and Delete Rows and Columns**: Quickly select and delete rows and columns as needed.
- **CSV Import and Export**: Import table data from CSV files and export your tables to CSV format.
- **Upload/Add Media**: Upload Media to the WordPress Media library and add to any table cell. (Media only outputs to the gnereated table on the website and not the exported .csv file)
- **Shortcode Integration**: Each table generates a shortcode that can be embedded into any page or post.
- **Tailwind CSS and Flowbite Integration**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and Flowbite for UI components.
